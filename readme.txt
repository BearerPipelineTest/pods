Pods is a framework for creating, managing, and deploying customized content types and fields for any project.

== Description ==

Manage all your custom content needs in one location with the Pods Framework.

* **Create content types** including Custom Post Types, Custom Taxonomies, and our special Advanced Content Types (ACTs get their own custom tables)
* **Extend and customize content types** including Posts, Pages, Categories, Tags, Users, and Media with one easy click
* **Create custom settings pages** easily within seconds
* **Add custom fields** to *any* content type or settings page
* **Group your fields** however you'd like into their own sections
* **Show your fields** anywhere using our [blocks](https://docs.pods.io/dispaying-pods/pods-bocks/), [shortcodes](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-shortcode/), [widgets](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/widgets/), the code-free [Pods Template](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-templates/) approach, or our [automatic theme integration](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/wordpress-theme-templates/)
* **Create connections** between any of your content with [relationship fields](https://docs.pods.io/fields/relationship-fields/) to keep your content organized

Let Pods help you grow your development skills and manage content beyond the standard WordPress Posts & Pages. Check out our [Documentation](https://docs.pods.io/), [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pods/), and our [Live Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) for help to build your dream project with Pods.

= Introduction =

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYEE2i3nPOM]

= Content types that evolve with your needs =

Create any type of content that you want -- small or large -- we've got you covered. Every content type created with Pods gets all the love it needs to grow up big and strong. You'll get an easy to use interface that lets you manage field groups, custom fields, and how your content type will look or function.

= Create new content types =

With Pods, you can create entirely new content types and settings pages.

* **Custom Post Types** - Content types that look and function like Posts and Pages, but in their own separate sections of WordPress
* **Custom Taxonomies** - Content types that look and function like Categories and Tags, but in their own separate sections of WordPress
* **Custom Settings Pages** - Create custom settings under Settings menu to help organize your site's custom global settings
* **Advanced Content Types** - These are entirely separate from WordPress and function off their own database tables (much like the [Drupal CCK](https://www.drupal.org/project/cck))

= Extend existing content types =

Need to customize your existing content types in WordPress? We offer the ability to extend existing content types across all of WordPress:

* **Post Types** - Customize and create/manage fields for any existing post type -- Posts, Pages, and even those created by plugins or themes
* **Taxonomies** - Customize and create/manage fields for any existing taxonomy -- Categories, Tags, and even those created by plugins or themes
* **Media** - Create and manage fields for your media uploads to enable you to fill in additional information and context to any image/file you want
* **Users** - Create and manage fields for your user/author profiles
* **Comments** - Create and manage fields for your visitor comments, easily add fields to fit the way you use comments as reviews and more

= Field Types =

We have an extensive collection of fields that you can leverage to build the perfect content structure for your site. You can also build your own custom field types with our extensible field type classes.

* **Text**
 * Plain Text
 * Website
 * Phone
 * E-mail
 * Password
* **Paragraph**
 * Plain Paragraph Text
 * WYSIWYG (Visual Editor)
 * Code (Syntax Highlighting)
* **Date / Time**
 * Date and Time
 * Date
 * Time
* **Number**
 * Plain Number
 * Currency (30+ international currencies)
* **Relationships / Media**
 * File / Image / Video (Media library and basic upload options available)
 * Avatar (for extended Users)
 * oEmbed
 * Relationship (Dropdowns, multiselect, autocomplete, checkboxes, radio buttons, and list views available)
* **Checkbox** (Yes / No)
* **Color Picker**

= Relationships to rule the world with =

The power is in your hands with our comprehensive support to **relate your content to anything**.

* **Custom defined lists** of text options
* Relate to any **Post Type or Taxonomy** posts / terms
* Relate to any **User** profile
* Relate to **User Roles or Capabilities**
* Relate to any **Comment**

And many other relationships are also available including:

* **Image Sizes**
* **Navigation Menus**
* Relate to content within **any Database Table**
* **Countries** (predefined)
* **US States** (predefined)
* **Canadian Provinces** (predefined)
* **Calendar - Days of Week** (predefined)
* **Calendar - Months of Year** (predefined)
* And many more!

= Optional Components to do even more =
You can enable some of our included components to extend your WordPress site even further:

* **Templates** - Use our template engine to create templates that can be handed off to clients for care-free management
* **Markdown Syntax** - Parses Markdown Syntax for Paragraph Text / WYSIWYG fields
* **Advanced Relationships** - Add advanced relationship objects for relating to including Database Tables, Multisite Networks, Multisite Sites, Themes, Page Templates, Sidebars, Post Type Objects, and Taxonomy Objects
* **Table Storage** - Enable table-based storage for custom fields on Post Types, Media, Users, and Comments
* **Roles and Capabilities** - Create or edit Roles for your site, and customize their corresponding capabilities
* **Advanced Content Types** - Create entirely custom content types that have their own table, they exist outside of the WordPress context and do not use meta tables
* **Pages** - Create custom pages that function off of your site's URL path, with wildcard support, and choose the Page Template to use -- most useful paired with Advanced Content Types

= Plays well with others =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I go for Support on your plugin? =

Our primary Support is handled through our [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pods/). For the fastest support, you can contact us on our [Live Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) in the #support channel. We do not staff our Slack channel 24/7, but we do check any questions that come through daily and reply to any unanswered questions.

We do have a community of Pods users and developers that hang out on Slack, so you're sure to get an answer quickly. We answer our Forum questions once a week with follow-up during the week as we're prioritizing resources towards restructuring and improving our documentation.

= Where do I report bugs or request features? =

If you’ve encountered a bug or have an idea for a new feature, we kindly request you to create an Issue on our GitHub Repository at [https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/issues/new](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/issues/new). Please be very specific about what steps you did to create the issue you’re having and include any screenshots or other configuration parameters to help us recreate or isolate the issue.

= Will Pods work with my Theme? =

Most likely the answer is yes. We don't require any special CSS or display attributes to use Pods with your theme, so you should have little to no difficulty showing your content in your theme. If you encounter any issues, contact your theme developer and ask them about their support for the standard WordPress theming functions and how to use [WordPress Template Hierarchy](https://wphierarchy.com) with their theme.

== How can I translate Pods into my own language? ==

Many thanks go out to the fine folks who have helped us translate the Pods plugin into many other languages.

Join us in further translating the Pods interface on the official [Translating WordPress dashboard](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/pods)

We are also available through our [Live Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) to help our translators get started and to support them on the process.

Are you looking to translate your Pods and Fields themselves? You'll want to enable the "Translate Pods" component from Pods Admin > Components.

== Screenshots ==

1. Create new content types or extend existing ones
2. Add fields of many types, with individual options for each, so you can define your content type to be what you need it to be
3. Post Type pods will add fields to the Post editor
4. Taxonomy pods will add fields to the Taxonomy forms
5. User pods will add fields to the User forms
6. Comment pods will add fields to the Comment forms
7. Media pods will add fields to the Media forms
8. Create Advanced Content Types that exist only as you define them, outside the normal WP object structure

== Contributors ==

Pods really wouldn't be where it is without all the contributions from our [donors](https://friends.pods.io) and [code/support contributors](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/graphs/contributors).

== Changelog ==

= 2.8 - October 12th, 2021 =

Read the full [Pods 2.8 Field Guide](https://pods.io/2021/02/11/pods-2-8-beta-1-released-and-the-field-guide-to-pods-2-8/) which includes information about all of the features, enhancements, and changes in this major Pods release.

**Breaking compatability warning:**
* New minimum required versions have been updated as follows which includes notices to let you know if you need to update something.
* New minimum WP version required: WordPress 5.5+ (previously: WP 4.5+) — Going forward we will support the last two major WP releases on each major feature release of Pods.
* New minimum PHP version required: PHP 5.6+ (previously: PHP 5.3+) — Hey! You should take the time to update to PHP 7.4+ because there’s major speed improvements to be had 🙂
* New minimum MySQL version required: MySQL 5.5+ (previously: MySQL 5.1+)
* Refactored object handling for Pod and Field configurations — instead of passing around arrays we now are using a fully scoped object for these configs. This gives us flexibility to lazy load and pull things as-needed from the database instead of always pulling entire Pods and Fields configurations all at once on any page it may not be needed. This also reduces how much we have to use/cache on each page further reducing overall memory usage on every page. It remains backward compatible in most array usage cases like `$pod['name']` but be aware that PHP ArrayAccess overloading errors may occur when manipulating Pod configs like `$pod['fields']['your_field']['name'] = 'My new field name';` or `$pod['options']['some_option'] = 1;` 

**Features and changes in this release**
* Feature: Now you can add multiple groups of fields. (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)
* Feature: Our Edit Pod screen is powered by our all new React form interfaces, tooltips, and they use our new Pods Admin REST API endpoints. (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)
* Feature: All of our form fields are powered by React now in preparation for Pods 2.9 repeatable fields that we're working on next. (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)
* Feature: New field types for Heading and HTML. (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser) 
* Feature: New Pods Blocks available and the underlying Pods Block PHP API is compatible with ACF Blocks if you've ever used those before. (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)
* Feature: REST API endpoints are now available to create/edit various objects: Pods, Pod Groups, and Pod Fields. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Feature: WP-CLI commands that mirror the REST API endpoints we have. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Feature: The new WYSIWYG editor option to use [Quill Editor](https://github.com/zenoamaro/react-quill) is now available and the CLEditor has been removed. (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)
* Compatibility: Completely updated compatibility with WPML and Polylang plugins.
