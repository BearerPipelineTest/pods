# Support

Pods contributors can have limited time and availability to address support inquiries so please be patient with us :)

## Getting support

When looking for support, please first search for your question in these venues:

* [Pods Docs](https://docs.pods.io/)
* [WordPress.org Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pods/)
* [Open or closed GitHub issues](https://github.com/pods-framework/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue)
* [Pods Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/)

GitHub issues are for tracking enhancements and bugs, not general support.

Please check out the official [Pods Support site](https://support.pods.io/) for more details for getting help with Pods and other our add-ons.

## Your rights

The open source license grants you the freedom to use Pods Framework. It does not guarantee commitments of other people's time. Please be respectful and manage your expectations.
